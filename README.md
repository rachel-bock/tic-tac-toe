# Tic-Tac-Toe Repository

I originally created this game in the html-and-css-practice repo.  It has been moved to this repo for preservation.

In this sandbox, I've created a tic-tac-toe game board using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I referenced the tutorial available at https://youtu.be/AzvpHNkjqsg while researching this project.
